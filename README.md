## Prerequisites
Before running the application, you will need to obtain an API key from Google AI Gemini.

### Steps to Get the API Key

2. Sign in with your Google account.
3. Generate an API key under the **Gemini API** section.
4. Copy the generated API key.

### Adding the API Key to the App
Once you have the API key, follow these steps to add it to the app:

1. Open the project in Xcode.
2. In the Project Navigator, locate the file named `Info.plist` in your app's main folder.
3. Add the following entry to your `Info.plist` file:

    ```xml
    <key>Api_Key</key>
    <string>YOUR_API_KEY_HERE</string>
    ```

   Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with the API key you copied from Google AI Studio.

4. Save the file and build the project.
